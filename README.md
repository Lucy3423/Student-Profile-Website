# AthenaAward  
I have programmed a hypothetical school portal which consists of 5 pages, a login, dashboard, bulletin board, student profile and lastly a clubs page where the user can add more clubs to their timetable.   
My aim for this project was to put my new knowledge of HTML and CSS to the test. I also wanted to create a backend to my website using Python and Flask.
Overall, I have really enjoyed making this project and am very pleased with the results, despite some of the challenges that I encountered along the way!
